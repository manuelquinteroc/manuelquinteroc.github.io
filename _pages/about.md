I am a second-year PhD student at MIT in the [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu/) and the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/), where I work on Statistics and Machine Learning under the supervision of Professor [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/). Prior to MIT, I received my master's degree in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge ([Part iii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos)) with a primary focus on Statistics, Probability, and Optimization. I also hold a BS in Applied Mathematics and a BA in Economics from [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/), Mexico.
