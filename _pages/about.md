I am a master student at the [Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS)](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/) at Cambridge University studying [Part iii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos) with focus on Mathematical Statistics. 
I consider myself a multidisciplinary individual with interest ranging from modern statistics, economics, and pure mathematics.
