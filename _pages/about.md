Bio
======

Before coming to Cambridge University, I completed a BS in Applied Mathematics and a BA in Economics at [ITAM](), where I graduated with the maximum distinction (Honor mention). Between my undergraduate studies and the master course I worked a Research Assistant for over three years with professors from ITAM, Harvard, MIT, and Columbia.
