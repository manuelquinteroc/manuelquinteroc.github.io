I am a first-year PhD student at the [Institute for Data Systems and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu/) at MIT. Prior to MIT, I received my master's degree in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge ([Part iii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos) with a primary focus on Statistics, Probability, and Optimization. I also hold a BS in Applied Mathematics and a BA in Economics from [ITAM](https://www.itam.mx/), Mexico.

Research
======

My current research interests lie in the intersection between machine learning and causal inference and applications in the social sciences, such as in development economics. In the past, I have worked with structural models, causal inference, and randomized control trials to understand and mitigate social problems.
