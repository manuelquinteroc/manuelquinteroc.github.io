        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Surety bonds are financial agreements between a contractor (principal) and obligee (project owner) to complete a project. However, most large-scale projects involve multiple contractors, creating a network and introducing the possibility of incomplete obligations to propagate and result in project failures. Typical models for risk assessment assume independent failure probabilities within each contractor. However, we take a network approach, modeling the contractor network as a directed graph where nodes represent contractors and project owners and edges represent contractual obligations with associated financial records. To understand risk propagation throughout the contractor network, we extend the celebrated Friedkin–Johnsen model and introduce a stochastic process to simulate principal failures across the network. From a theoretical perspective, we show that under natural monotonicity conditions on the contractor network, incorporating network effects leads to increases in both the average risk and the tail probability mass of the loss distribution (that is, larger right-tail risk) for the surety organization. We further use data from a partnering insurance company to validate our findings, estimating an approximately 2% higher exposure when accounting for network effects.

        <strong>Abstract:</strong> In science and social science, we often wish to explain why an outcome is different in two populations. 
        For instance, if a jobs program benefits members of one city more than another, is that due to differences in program participants 
        (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given covariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is 
        a standard tool in econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two populations. However, the KOB decomposition 
        assumes a linear relationship between covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be meaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine 
        learning boasts a variety of nonlinear functional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates in one population. 
        It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these functional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not 
        attribute the differences to covariates—or, respectively, outcomes given covariates — if those are the same in the two populations. 
        Unfortunately, we demonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions —the functional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects— 
        can attribute differences to outcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We provide a characterization of 
        when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a general property that any decomposition must satisfy to avoid misattribution. We show that 
        if the decomposition is independent of its input distribution, it does not misattribute. We further conjecture that misattribution.
